.NET/C#, NUnit, Selenium framework



NUnit vs TestNG
-Annotations vs properties
@Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod
[Test], [SetUp], [Teardown]

-Assertions
Assert.assertTrue(), Assert.assertEquals()
Assert.That(), Assert.Equal(), Assert.Null(), Assert.Empty()


Java vs C#
-They are both OOP languages so switching fomr one to other is a easy process.
-There are slight syntax differences, but it is easy to adapt.
-Java is strict OOP while C# is OOP but it also provides some functional programming.



Compiled languages: Java, C#		has compiler and strict rules
	They was wrong! // Compiler error

Interpret languages:  JavaScript  
	They was wrong! // Interprets this as "They were wrong!" and works.  





IMPROVEMENTS:
-Move setup and teardown actions in a base class and implement inheritance for better code reusability
-Centralize web elements using Page Object Model design pattern
-Utils: Driver, Waiter etc.


BENEFITS of Page Object Model design pattern?
-Reusability
-Maintanence


BasePage basePage = new BasePage();
